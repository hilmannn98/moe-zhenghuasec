#### Key Achievements

##### Live On Design Competition 2020 - Third Prize

Art Club members hone their skills and exercise their creativity by learning a variety of art forms in a year. This year, in the Ceramics programme, they learnt to shape clay into intricate figurines, wind chimes and teapots.

As the Club moved our weekly sessions online, members also organized meaningful online projects, like the “Fold a Heart” initiative to encourage each other during home-based learning. Zylia Tan (3E3) even came forward to plan online workshops for the Club on text and character designs.

The Club is also becoming a home for members who are enthusiastic about digital art. They have applied their skills in designing the “Do it Right” badges to commend exemplary students, and submitted their creations fo the “Live On Festival” organized by the Ministry of Health.
