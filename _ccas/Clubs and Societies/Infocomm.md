The students participated in the Singapore Digital Media Awards (SDMA). This year, to further challenge themselves, the members participated in two categories:  Video and Photo Essay. The students worked hard to produce an original video that takes a closer look at the issue of cyberbullying. The video even starred one of the teachers-in-charge, Mr Koh Eng Huat, who plays a villainous principal!

The Photo Essay team spent a productive day at Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve over the March holidays. Besides soaking in the tranquil environment, the team captured some beautiful shots of this paradise on earth, depicting their message of the importance of conservation of Singapore’s natural environment.
