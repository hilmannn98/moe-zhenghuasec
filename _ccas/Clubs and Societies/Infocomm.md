| The Infocomm Club started off 2017 fruitfully by honing <br>their skills in videography, video <br>editing, Photoshop skills and photography. | <img src="/images/infocomm%201.jpg" style="width:65%">Interacting with our schoolmates at our National Day carnival booth |
| The students participated in the Singapore Digital Media Awards (SDMA). This year, to further challenge themselves, the members participated in two categories:  Video and Photo Essay. The students worked hard to produce an original video that takes a closer look at the issue of cyberbullying. The video even starred one of the teachers-in-charge, Mr Koh Eng Huat, who plays a villainous principal! | <img src="/images/infocomm%202.jpg" style="width:55%">Behind the scenes of our SDMA video about cyberbullying |
| The Photo Essay team spent a productive day at Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve over the March holidays. Besides soaking in the tranquil environment, the team captured some beautiful shots of this paradise on earth, depicting their message of the importance of conservation of Singapore’s natural environment.|<img src="/images/infocomm%203.jpg" style="width:55%">The SDMA Photojournalism group taking shots at Sungei Buloh |
