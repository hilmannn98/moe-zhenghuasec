#### Achievements

**SYF 2021 - Certificate of Accomplishment**

Zhenghua Secondary Concert Band is an inclusive music CCA which welcomes students who are interested to learn music and band instruments regardless of their musical backgrounds. With the patient support of our conductors and teachers, we aim to help our students advance their music performance abilities and cultivate a deep appreciation and understanding of the arts.

Despite SMM restrictions on wind instrument CCA practices, we persisted in our training sessions by having Zoom practice sessions and even practices at open air locations with adequate safe distancing to prepare for the SYF Arts Presentation. The instructors also adopted online lessons, quizzes and apps to support the learning of our new members while keeping lessons interesting and varied.

Through our efforts, we continue to strive for excellence and showcase riveting performances that will cheer and comfort our audiences in these trying times.
