In Basketball, our boys pride themselves on training diligently twice a week, focusing on ball-handling skills, footwork, defensive and offensive formation play. Even though our yearly friendly matches and competitions have been postponed due to Covid-19, the players have continued to build their stamina through physical conditioning training held over Zoom e-CCA sessions. The continuation of these sessions have provided opportunities for our boys to continue strengthening their bonds with each other as we recognize that building camaraderie is the bedrock for good team play. As the Covid situation improves, our boys will continue to train their physical fitness and mental discipline as they eagerly await their return to the court!
