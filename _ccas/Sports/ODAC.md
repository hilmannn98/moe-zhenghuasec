We started the year by cycling to Coney Island Park in Punggol. It was the first time the secondary 1 members headed out of school with us. Andrea and Ain displayed their resilience and perseverance to overcome their fear of cycling and it was such a great achievement for both of them! We ended term 1 with a 2D1N camp and it was a blast. We played water games, did outdoor cooking, and pitched our own tents. We took a walk to Labrador Park on the second day. We learnt about the history of Labrador and also the nature and heritage of Singapore when we had the rare opportunity to come into contact with the moult of a cicada.

In term 2, we organised the Intra School Rock Climbing and received overwhelming responses for participation. It was a really exciting session as the competitive spirit was so high. We also participated in the G.A.R.a.n.g Race 2017 where we broadened our orienteering knowledge.
