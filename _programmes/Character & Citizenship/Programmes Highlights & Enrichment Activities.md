### Programmes Highlights & Enrichment Activities

The school’s CLC Programme aims to develop principled and future-ready leaders by engaging students in a wide range of learning experiences that are authentic and relevant to students’ lived realities.

With the changing socio-political climate, we endeavor to nurture citizens with a sense of belonging, reality, and hope. By discussing contemporary issues with classmates, students engage with events happening in society and develop multiple perspectives.

For example, students explored our local food heritage and the challenge of sustaining hawker culture as we celebrated its inscription onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural of Humanity, building a sense of pride in our culture.

We continue to adapt and seize new opportunities afforded by technology amidst the challenge of the pandemic. Programmes like the Secondary 1 Family Matters VIA project have gone online, leveraging blended learning days.

Aware of the impact the pandemic has had on our community, the school continued with key programmes such as the CNY community outreach to the rental blocks. These learning experiences develop our students to be active citizens with the will to act.

#### Social and Emotional Learning

Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) contributes to students’ well-being. SEL enables our students to live out the values that guide their lives. Through SEL, students develop the skills to manage themselves, build healthy relationships and make responsible decisions.

*   Self-awareness: Know your strengths and limitations, with a well-grounded sense of confidence, optimism, and a “growth mindset”.
*   Self-management: Effectively manage stress, control impulses, and motivate yourself to set and achieve goals.
*   Social awareness: Understand the perspectives of others and empathise with them, including those from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
*   Relationship management: Communicate clearly, listen well, cooperate with others, resist inappropriate social pressure, negotiate conflict constructively, and seek and offer help when needed.
*   Responsible decision-making: Make constructive choices about personal behaviour and social interactions based on ethical standards, safety, and social norms.

#### Student Recognition

A holistic education system places exemplary character on par with academic excellence. MOE and the school recognises the importance of acknowledging students who have demonstrated good character, values and leadership. These awards serve as a celebration and recognition of the achievement of our students.

*   Edusave Character Award
	*   The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) is given by MOE and recognises students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.
* Principled Leader Award
	* The Principled Leader Award recognises students from each cohort who demonstrate exemplary leadership qualities.
* School Values Award

#### Values in Action

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students' development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of the VIA programme, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

Our aim is to ensure that by the end of a students’ time with the school, they would have experienced the various aspects of community service and developed a sense of compassion for the less fortunate, echoing one of our school values of serving with compassion.

Our VIA programme is designed to expose students to a variety of community needs.

*   Secondary 1 – Environmental advocacy in partnership with kindergartens in the community
*   Secondary 2 – Building an inclusive society for people with disabilities
*   Secondary 3 – Appreciating and caring for our seniors
*   Secondary 4 – Community Champions Project
*   Secondary 5 – Serving residents in the Bukit Panjang Community (CNY outreach to rental blocks)

Beyond the cohort VIA programmes, CCAs also have customised VIA experiences for students. For example, students from the Performing Arts CCAs regularly visit seniors at Bo Tien Day Activity Centre for the Elderly.
