### Programmes Highlights & Enrichment Activities

Our Aesthetic programme promotes awareness and appreciation of art forms by exposing students to dance, music, drama and the visual arts. Students also experience creating music in analogue and digital forms using their Chromebooks.

Selected students are also given opportunities this year to participate in activities such as the Singapore Youth Festival Song Writing Project “Youth Station”, and the Music and Higher Education Career Fair.
Other than the compositional skills that I learnt from our teachers, the project made my dream of song composition come true. It taught me that persevere through difficult times”.

-Lim Si Sen (3E4), “Youth Station” participant

The talks have benefitted me in answering doubts like whether I would lose interest and motivation to continue pursuing music. The fair taught me to believe that dreams come true for people who strive hard.

Learning about the Neapolitan 6th Chord
Our programme seeks to empower all students with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to appreciate and participate in music. Musical understanding is developed through listening and responding; creating and performing. The learning of musical elements and concepts provides students with the means to understand and engage with music across genres and traditions of local and global cultures.
