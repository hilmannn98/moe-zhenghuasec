### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

#### School Green Awards - Lotus Sustained Achievement Award
Zhenghua Secondary School attained the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award in 2017. We wish to thank our students and staff for making this possible.

**Thrash to Cash** <br>
Another programme that saw the active participation of the students and teachers was the recycling drive where newspapers and magazines were collected and sold for cash. This taught students the importance of caring for their environment. Every classroom has a Recycling Station for students to store their recyclables which are then turned to cash.

On the day of the event, our students set up the booth, arranged the products, distributed the filers and promoted their product. They also delivered the green message and convinced the members of the public to visit their booth.
