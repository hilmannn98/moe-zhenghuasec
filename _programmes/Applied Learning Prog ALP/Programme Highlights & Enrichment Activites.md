### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

Our Applied Learning Programme is undergoing a revamp this year to expand its focus beyond mbot and robotics but a broader theme on Future of Transportation. The new programme remains two-tiered. Tier 1 programme includes mbot for Secondary 1, Maqueen and Drone for Secondary 2 while Tier 2 programme is interest-based covering STEM Day and STEM related enrichment activities.

Riding on the heels of increasing popularity for product delivery, the Secondary 2 programme will allow students to experience planning for logistics supply in a metropolitan and using Maqueen robots and flying drones to carry out the delivery tasks through team activities.
