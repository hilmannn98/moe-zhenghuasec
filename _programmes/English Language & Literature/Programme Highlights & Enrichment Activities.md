### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

The belief that every student is able to grow in their repertoire and knowledge of the English language as they journey with us at Zhenghua Secondary School is a belief that the English and Literature department holds close to our hearts. It forms the crux of how we teach, prepare, develop and nurture our learners into confident, reflective, critical thinkers and communicators of the 21st century.

Through our signature programmes, the English and Literature department aims to unlock our students’ hidden potential and encourage the rich exploration of language in innovative ways beyond the classroom. Every year, students participate in the annual EL and Humanities Week, where they try their hand at blackout poetry, English puzzles and more, to explore the language in fun and immersive ways. Our debate, drama and creative writing workshops help to foster rich learning in students as they delve into different facets of language learning, while also cultivating their various talents and interests. To further stretch them beyond their comfort zones, the department also supports students as they participate in competitions such as the Orator’s Trophy, National Schools Literature Festival and Write for Kindness competition. All these and more await you in our English and Literature classrooms!

In a bid to immerse students in an English and Literature-rich environment, students at Zhenghua enjoy a meaningful week of fun and enriching activities in and out of the classroom. They enjoyed flash fiction writing, blackout poetry, movie screenings, talks by local writers and poets and participate in school-wide competitions such as the Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) and the ACJC Orator’s Trophy. To further increase their awareness and competence in the language, students participate actively in external events and competitions that are held every year. These include the Inter-School Philosophy Dialogue, the All In! Young Writers Festival, and the Unity Young Writers’ Festival. Through the various signature programmes, students are provided the necessary scaffold and structures to grow and learn in a spiral progression fashion.
