### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

The belief that every student is able to grow in their repertoire and knowledge of the English language as they journey with us at Zhenghua Secondary School is a belief that the English and Literature department holds close to our hearts. It forms the crux of how we teach, prepare, develop and nurture our learners into confident, reflective, critical thinkers and communicators of the 21st century.

Through our signature programmes, the English and Literature department aims to unlock our students’ hidden potential and encourage the rich exploration of language in innovative ways beyond the classroom. Every year, students participate in the annual EL and Humanities Week, where they try their hand at blackout poetry, English puzzles and more, to explore the language in fun and immersive ways. Our debate, drama and creative writing workshops help to foster rich learning in students as they delve into different facets of language learning, while also cultivating their various talents and interests. To further stretch them beyond their comfort zones, the department also supports students as they participate in competitions such as the Orator’s Trophy, National Schools Literature Festival and Write for Kindness competition. All these and more await you in our English and Literature classrooms!
