### Programme Highlights and Enrichment Activities

It has been yet another fulfilling year for our science students, as the science department enriched the students’ learning experience with an array of learning opportunities, both in and out of the classroom.

##### Bacteria Transformation Workshop @ The Science Centre

4E3 Biology students entered the exciting world of genetic engineering by using sophisticated laboratory equipment and techniques to genetically transform bacteria to glow in florescence.

##### Making Learning Fun - Problem-based Learning and e-Pedagogy

Assuming the role of material engineers, Secondary 3 Physics students executed experiments to determine if unearthed sheath fragments originated from pure gold swords left behind by General Yamashita before he fled Singapore in 1945.

Meanwhile, Secondary 3 Chemistry students adopted various roles to manage a  mock chemical spill crisis. As scientists, environmentalists or doctors, they conducted experiments to determine the nature of the chemical spill and reported how they could deal with the spill in their respective capacities via video conference.

Science learning also became hands-on, as our lower secondary students constructed water purification devices using recycled materials.

With these authentic tasks, learning was made relevant and fun for our students!
